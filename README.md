Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests

A Matlab implementation of the Random Forest Discriminative Components algorithm described in [[1]](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets/food-101/static/bossard_eccv14_food-101.pdf) for automatically recognizing pictured dishes. The implementation achieves about a top-1 accuracy of 46%  and a top-5 accuracy of 70% on the challenging food-101 dataset which contains 101000 images of 101 food categories. The dataset can be found [here](http://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/food-101.tar.gz).
