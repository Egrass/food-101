Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests - Matlab Implementation

In this paper we address the problem of automatically rec-
ognizing pictured dishes. To this end, we introduce a novel method to
mine discriminative parts using Random Forests (rf), which allows us
to mine for parts simultaneously for all classes and to share knowledge
among them. To improve efficiency of mining and classification, we only
consider patches that are aligned with image superpixels, which we call
components. To measure the performance of our rf component mining
for  food  recognition, we introduce a novel and challenging  dataset of
101 food categories, with 101'000 images.
